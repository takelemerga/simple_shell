# Simple Shell Project

## simple_shell
* A simple Unix command interpreter.
## Project Description
* this project is a simpler version of the linux shell.
It englobes the essential parts that we've learned in C and Linux during the first Trimester at Holberton School.
A user of this simple shell, can run different functionalities that the real shell does.

## Technologies and Concepts
- C.
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).

## CREATION
This simple shell was created an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Operating system, using the C programming language.
## The essential Simple Shell Functionalities:
* Passing Betty (code style checker for holberton C coding standards) checks.
* Displaying a prompt and wait for user input.
* Handling errors.
* Handling commands.
* Handling commands with arguments.
* Handling **EOF** condition.
* Handling the **PATH** environment variable.
* Implementing the **exit** built-in, that exits the shell.
* Implementing the **env** built-in.

## The functions and system calls that we're allowed to use:
* access (man 2 access)
* chdir (man 2 chdir)
* close (man 2 close)
* closedir (man 3 closedir)
* execve (man 2 execve)
* exit (man 3 exit)
* _exit (man 2 _exit)
* fflush (man 3 fflush)
* fork (man 2 fork)
* free (man 3 free)
* getcwd (man 3 getcwd)
* getline (man 3 getline)
* isatty (man 3 isatty)
* kill (man 2 kill)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* open (man 2 open)
* opendir (man 3 opendir)
* perror (man 3 perror)
* read (man 2 read)
* readdir (man 3 readdir)
* signal (man 2 signal)
* stat (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
* lstat (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
* fstat (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
* strtok (man 3 strtok)
* wait (man 2 wait)
* waitpid (man 2 waitpid)
* wait3 (man 2 wait3)
* wait4 (man 2 wait4)
* write (man 2 write)

# SHELL General Knowledge:

# Unix shell
- It's a command line interpreter.
- It gets commands from a user through a terminal emulator.
- It comes between the OS Kernel and the user, offering the possibility for the
user to access an OS's services.
- The shell wraps around delicate interiour of an OS, protecting it from an accidental
damage.

## Thompson shell
- It's the first Unix shell, introduced in the 1st Unix version in 1971.
- It was written by Ken Thompson.
- It was a simple command interpreter.
- It was created by Kenneth Lane 'Ken' Thompson.

## Ken Thompson
- Born in Feb 4th 1943.
- Is a computer scientist.
- He Holds a BS and MS in EE and CS from the UC Berkeley.
- He worked at Bell Labs, Google...
- He's known for Unix, B (pro lang), UTF-8, Go...
- He has multiple awards, such as Turing's, IEEE's, Japan prize...

## How does a shell work?
- an OS is made of many componenets, but its 2 main ones are the Kernel and the
shell.
- The kernel is the nucleus of the OSs. It communicates between hardware and sofware.
- The end user write something on the terminal (input/output interface). The shell
interpretes what's written to the kernel. The kernel gets the interpretations from
the shell and does its job.
